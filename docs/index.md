# XBOX360Controller

The controller provides a unified interface so that games can be developed and played cross-platform without worrying about how axes and buttons are mapped on different OSs.

## Files:

### xbox360_controller.py

The controller class which can be used in pygame projects.

### visualizer.py

See the values returned by an xbox360_controller object on a graphical mockup of the controller.

### simple_game_template.py

This demonstrates usage of the xbox360_controler class and can be used as a template for a game. Press 'start' to begin the game. The ball in the middle is controlled by the left stick. Pressing 'back' resets the game.

### test.py

Plug in a controller and check the raw values returned by each button/axis. This is just slightly modified joystick example code from the joystick documentation page.
